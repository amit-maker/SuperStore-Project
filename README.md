# SuperStore-Project
This project focuses on analyzing sales performance of a retail superstore using only Python. The data is loaded directly from a CSV file and processed using Pandas for manipulation, NumPy for calculations, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization. The aim is to generate actionable insights to help the business improve sales strategy, inventory planning, and customer segmentation.

üéØ Objectives:
   Analyze sales and profit trends by category, sub-category, region, and customer segment
   Identify low-profit/high-sales products
   Detect seasonal trends and monthly performance
   Explore relationships between discounts and profitability
   Create visual reports for business decision-making
